0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

Inheritance: Understanding how to create subclasses that inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. This allows you to create a hierarchy of classes with shared functionality.

Polymorphism: Learning about polymorphism and how to implement it in Python, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

Method Overriding: Understanding how to override methods from a parent class in a subclass to provide specialized behavior.

Class Composition: Exploring the concept of class composition, where you create complex objects by combining instances of simpler classes.

Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Learning about abstract classes and interfaces, which provide a way to define a common structure for classes that must be implemented by subclasses.

Magic Methods (Dunder Methods): Understanding and using special methods in Python, such as __init__, __str__, __repr__, and others, to customize the behavior of your classes.

Decorators and Class Methods: Exploring how decorators and class methods can be used to modify the behavior of classes and methods.

Advanced Class Design Patterns: Studying advanced class design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer, which can be used to solve specific programming problems.

Metaclasses: Learning about metaclasses, which allow you to customize class creation and behavior at a higher level.

Design Principles: Understanding and applying design principles like SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to write clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

Real-world Examples: Working with real-world examples and projects that demonstrate the practical application of advanced class and object concepts.

This subject would likely build on the foundational knowledge of classes and objects in Python and help you become a more proficient and advanced Python programmer. It's important to have a strong grasp of basic OOP concepts in Python before diving into more advanced topics like those listed above.
