0x07. Python - Test-driven development

"Test-driven development" (TDD) is a software development methodology. Here's what this might mean in this context:

Python: This indicates that the topic is related to the Python programming language. Python is a popular and widely-used programming language known for its readability and versatility.

Test-driven development (TDD): TDD is a software development approach where developers write tests for a piece of code before they actually write the code itself. The process typically involves the following steps:

Write a failing test: Create a test that defines the expected behavior of the code you're about to write.
Write the code: Write the minimum amount of code needed to make the test pass.
Run the test: Verify that the code passes the test.
Refactor (if needed): If necessary, improve the code's design while ensuring the test still passes.
Repeat: Continue this cycle for each piece of functionality.
From this, you can learn that this section of your learning materials likely covers the principles and practices of test-driven development in the context of Python programming. It's a methodology used to ensure code quality, maintainability, and to catch bugs early in the development process. It promotes a structured approach to writing code by starting with clear expectations and tests.
