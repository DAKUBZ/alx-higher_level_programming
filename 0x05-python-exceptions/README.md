0x05. Python - Exceptions

Python exceptions are a crucial aspect of error handling in Python programming. They allow you to gracefully handle errors that may occur during the execution of your code. Exceptions help prevent your program from crashing abruptly and provide a way to give meaningful feedback to users or developers about what went wrong.

Python's exception handling mechanisms allow you to create robust and resilient programs by gracefully handling various error scenarios. By using try, except, else, and finally blocks effectively, you can control how your program behaves in the face of unexpected events.
